# Radiohead
Recreates the old animation from http://www.radiohead.com/ <br>
On Windows, press alt+f4 to close the program.

Originally, this was a malicious program I made as a study on input blocking. I got rid of the malicious elements but kept the animation because I'm a diehard Radiohead fan and enjoy the animation. 

Before "A Moon Shaped Pool" was released, the old Radiohead website had links to a couple other sites and an animation in the background. I recreated it by downloading the spritesheet, cycling through each sprite, and blowing each sprite up, and applying a kernel to blur the pixels. I put a delay of 80 milliseconds between each frame.
