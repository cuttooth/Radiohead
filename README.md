Originally, this was a prank program for the computers in my high school to block any user input to the computer. I got rid of the malicious elements but kept the animation because I'm a die-hard Radiohead fan and enjoy the animation. 

Before "A Moon Shaped Pool" was released, the old Radiohead website had an animation for the background. I recreated it by downloading the spritesheet, blurring each sprite, and pausing for ~80ms between sprites.
